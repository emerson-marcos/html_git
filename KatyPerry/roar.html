                <h1>Roar</h1>
                <p>
                    I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath <br/>
                    Scared to rock the boat and make a mess <br/>
                    So I sat quietly, agreed politely <br/>
                    I guess that I forgot I had a choice <br/>
                    I let you push me past the breaking point <br/>
                    I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything <br/><br/>

                    You held me down, but I got up (hey) <br/>
                    Already brushing off the dust <br/>
                    You hear my voice, you hear that sound <br/>
                    Like thunder, gonna shake the ground <br/>
                    You held me down, but I got up (hey) <br/>
                    Get ready 'cause I've had enough <br/>
                    I see it all, I see it now <br/><br/>

                    I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter <br/>
                    Dancing through the fire <br/>
                    'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar <br/>
                    Louder, louder than a lion <br/>
                    'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar <br/><br/>

                    Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh <br/> 
                    Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh <br/>
                    Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh <br/>
                    You're gonna hear me roar <br/><br/>
