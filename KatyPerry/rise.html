                <p>
                    I won't just survive <br/>
                    Oh, you will see me thrive <br/>
                    Can write my story <br/>
                    I'm beyond the archetype <br/>
                    I won't just conform <br/>
                    No matter how you shake my core <br/>
                    Cause my roots, they run deep, oh <br/><br/>

                    Oh ye of so little faith <br/>
                    Don't doubt it, don't doubt it <br/>
                    Victory is in my veins <br/>
                    I know it, I know it <br/>
                    And I will not negotiate <br/>
                    I'll fight it, I'll fight it <br/>
                    I will transform <br/><br/>

                    When, when the fire's at my feet again <br/>
                    And the vultures all start circling <br/>
                    They're whispering, "you're out of time. " <br/>
                    But still, I rise <br/>
                    This is no mistake, no accident <br/>
                    When you think the final nail is in, think again <br/>
                    Don't be surprised, I will still rise <br/><br/>
                    
                    I must stay conscious <br/>
                    Through the madness and chaos <br/>
                    So I call on my angels <br/>
                    They say <br/><br/>

                    Oh ye of so little faith <br/>
                    Don't doubt it, don't doubt it <br/>
                    Victory is in your veins <br/>
                    You know it, you know it <br/>
                    And you will not negotiate <br/>
                    Just fight it, just fight it <br/>
                    And be transformed <br/><br/>
                    
                    Cause when, when the fire's at my feet again <br/>
                    And the vultures all start circling <br/>
                    They're whispering, "you're out of time. " <br/>
                    But still, I rise <br/>
                    This is no mistake, no accident <br/>
                    When you think the final nail is in, think again <br/>
                    Don't be surprised, I will still rise <br/><br/>
                    
                    Don't doubt it, don't doubt <br/>
                    Oh oh, oh oh <br/>
                    You know it, you know it <br/>
                    Still rise <br/>
                    Just fight it, just fight it <br/>
                    Don't be surprised, I will still rise <br/><br/>
