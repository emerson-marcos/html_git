                <p>
                    Do you ever feel <br/>
                    Like a plastic bag <br/>
                    Drifting through the wind <br/>
                    Wanting to start again <br/><br/>

                    Do you ever feel <br/>
                    Feel so paper-thin <br/>
                    Like a house of cards <br/>
                    One blow from caving in <br/><br/>

                    Do you ever feel <br/>
                    Already buried deep <br/>
                    Six feet under <br/>
                    Screams but no one seems to hear a thing <br/><br/>

                    Do you know that there's <br/>
                    Still a chance for you <br/>
                    'Cause there's a spark in you <br/>
                    You just gotta <br/><br/>

                    Ignite the light <br/>
                    And let it shine <br/>
                    Just own the night <br/>
                    Like the Fourth of July <br/>
                    'Cause baby, you're a firework <br/>
                    Come on show 'em what you're worth <br/>
                    Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah" <br/>
                    As you shoot across the sky <br/><br/>

                    Baby, you're a firework <br/>
                    Come on let your colors burst <br/>
                    Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah" <br/>
                    You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe <br/><br/>

                    You don't have to feel <br/>
                    Like a waste of space <br/>
                    You're original <br/>
                    Cannot be replaced <br/><br/>

                    If you only knew <br/>
                    What the future holds <br/>
                    After a hurricane <br/>
                    Comes a rainbow <br/>

                    Maybe a reason why <br/>
                    All the doors were closed <br/>
                    So you could open one <br/>
                    That leads you to the perfect road <br/><br/>

                    Like a lightning bolt <br/>
                    Your heart will glow <br/>
                    And when it's time you'll know <br/>
                    You just gotta <br/><br/>
