                <p>
                    I know that we are young <br/>
                    And I know that you may love me <br/>
                    But I just can't be with you like this anymore <br/>
                    Alejandro <br/><br/>
                    
                    (Uh uh uh oh oh oh uh oh oh) <br/>
                    (Uh uh uh oh oh oh uh oh oh) <br/><br/>
                    
                    She's got both hands <br/>
                    In her pocket <br/>
                    And she won't look at you <br/>
                    Won't look at you <br/>
                    She hides true love <br/>
                    En su bolsillo <br/>
                    She's got a halo around her finger <br/>
                    Around you <br/><br/>
                    
                    You know that I love you boy <br/>
                    Hot like Mexico, rejoice <br/>
                    At this point I gotta choose <br/>
                    Nothing to lose <br/><br/>
                    
                    Don't call my name <br/>
                    Don't call my name, Alejandro <br/>
                    I'm not your babe <br/>
                    I'm not your babe, Fernando <br/><br/>
                    
                    Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch <br/>
                    Just smoke my cigarette and hush <br/>
                    Don't call my name <br/>
                    Don't call my name, Roberto <br/>
                    Alejandro <br/>
                    Alejandro <br/>
                    Ale-ale-jandro <br/>

                    (Just stop. Please. Just let me go. Alejandro <br/>
                    Just let me go) <br/><br/>
                    
                    She's not broken <br/>
                    She's just a baby <br/>
                    But her boyfriend's like a dad, just like a dad <br/>
                    Draw those flames that burn before him <br/>
                    Now he's gonna find a fight, gonna fool the bad <br/><br/>
                    
                    You know that I love you boy <br/>
                    Hot like Mexico, rejoice <br/>
